# Heya fellas,
Welcome to my first full-stack containerized project using `MERN` and `Docker`.

**Job Application Tracker** is a project which includes features for an individual to track there job applications with `status` and `timeline` functionalities.

## Intension:
The main intension of building this project is to understand `MongoDB`, `React` and `ExpressJS` establishment and how they work together. Later I integrated it with `Docker` and a `PowerShell` script.

## Features:
In this project some features related to job-application-tracking are present:
1. Auth - Login/Register using JWT
2. Job application tracker management system and timeline support.
3. Resume upload support for each job application.
4. CRUD operations related to job queries.
5. Resposive layout
6. Dockerised infrastructure with volume persistence

## How to use it:
There are particularly 2 different ways to use/monitor my project:
1. Via [Github](https://github.com/Peeyush-04/job-application-tracker) ~ *Use this only when you have complete docker setup in your local system and you want to build this project via yourself.* (directly run `.\start.ps1` for Windows)
2. Via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/opt1mal04/job-application-tracker) ~ *Use this if you want to work with images.* (run `docker-compose up -d`)
